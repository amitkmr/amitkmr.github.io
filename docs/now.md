# What I'am doing right now

## Work

I am currently building [R'Dash](https://rdash.io), which is B2B SaaS product for construction industry. Overall goal of the product is to make life of the stakeholders easier by providing them with the tools to manage their projects. `R'Dash` makes it really easy to manage your projects, designs, documents, and people. It also provides you with the tools to collaborate with people easliy, and to keep track of your projects progress.

At [91squarefeet](https://www.linkedin.com/company/91sqft), I am currently working as Director of Engineering, leading a wonderful team of 25 people, and we are all working hard to make `R'Dash` the best product in project management domain of construction industry.

On personal front, I am also grooming myself to develop more of width of skillset, from developing a product mindset to learning about business, and also learning about the domain of construction industry.


## Hobbies

In the past, mostly I have been an introvert person, but now I am trying to be more of a people person. On weekends I am trying to meet lots of interesting people from differnt walks of life.

I love to read books, but not able to devote as much time I want, I am currently re-reading [On Wrriting Well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well) by William Zinsser. This is inline with my goal of becoming a better writer. In my short term goal, I am trying to develop writing habit. This personal website is one of the step towards that goal.
