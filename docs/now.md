# What I'am doing right now

## Work

I am currently building [R'Dash](https://rdash.io), which is a B2B managed marketplace for the construction industry. Overall goal of the product is to make the life of the stakeholders easier by providing them with the tools to manage their projects effectively. `R'Dash` simplifies project management with its user-friendly interface for managing construction projects across stages such as recce, design, BOQ,subcontracting and progress reporting.

At [91squarefeet](https://www.linkedin.com/company/91sqft), I am currently working as Director of Engineering, leading the engineering efforts of the company to build a cutting-edge product in the construction domain.

On a personal front, I am grooming myself to develop more width in my skill set by developing a product mindset, learning about business, and also learning about the domain of construction industry.


## Hobbies

In the past, I have been an introverted person mostly, but now I am trying to be more of a people person. On weekends I try to meet a lot of interesting people from different walks of life.

I love to read books. But I am not able to devote as much time as I want, so I am also working to build a reading habit daily. I am currently reading [On Writing Well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well) by William Zinsser. This is inline with my goal of developing writing habits.
