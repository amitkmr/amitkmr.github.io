# [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://www.amazon.in/Almanack-Naval-Ravikant-Wealth-Happiness/dp/9354893899)

### What motivated me to read this?

I got the recommendation for this book while I was looking for something around wealth creation, I was looking more of something other than ideas in terms of developing a mindset and philosophy for wealth creation. I really like naval's take on how to create wealth and happiness in your life. This book is antidote to all of those ideas where people are looking for quick rich schemes. Real wealth creation is a long term game played with long term relationship.

### What are your top 2-3 learnings from the book?
- Wealth and happiness is a long term game, when you deeply start understanding the long term consequences of the actions, it leads to weath creation path.
- Become a life long learner, almost all of the wealth gets created on the edges of current understanding of how the world works. Unless you read a lot and get good understanding of world's working, its very difficult to guess, what could happen on edges.
- Technology is a leverage in a capitalistic world. it's what seperate us from the animals, almost all of our civilazation progress has happened through technology. New progress in technology creates opportunites for massive wealth creation.
