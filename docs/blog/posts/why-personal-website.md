# Why personal website?

Personal website is a place where you can share your thoughts, ideas, and life. It is a place where you can share your knowledge and experience with the world. Of course there are many ways to achieve the same, and till now I have mostly employed those ways to share with the world.

I have been living a very private life, which I enjoys to its fullest. There are very few things which makes life more richer than family, couple of great friends and meaningful work. Over time I have developed a framework of life which works well for me, but in doing so I have borrowed lots of wonderful ideas from the people who are not in my contact. It has been only possible because they have shared their ideas and thoughts with the world either through their blog or through their books.

This personal website is an attempt to give back to the world, and to share my ideas and thoughts with the world. And more than that, I want to share my life with the world. I want to share my journey of life, my learnings, my failures and my successes.

Over the years I have developed a strong aversion to the usage of social media, and particularly as social media platforms started monitizing the attention of their users. Unlike social media this personal website is an attempt to share my life and thoughts with the world in an non-intrusive way. Also I will make sincere effort to share a very meaningful content and curated content on this website.

Earlier also, I made an half hearted attempt to have my own personal website, but honestly I was not sure about what kind of content I would share on that. But now, I have taken up this challenge so, I will make it a worth attempt.
