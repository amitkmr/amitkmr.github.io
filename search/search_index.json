This personal website is a manifestation of my desire to impart my knowledge, experiences, and thoughts with the world. It is a vessel for sharing the essence of who I am and what I stand for.</p> <p>For many years, I have lived a private life, surrounded by the love of my family and close friends, and fueled by meaningful work. During this time, I have cultivated a way of life that brings me immense joy and fulfillment. This has been possible in part because of the wisdom and insights shared by those who have gone before me - individuals who have generously shared their perspectives through their writing and works.</p> <p>In turn, I now wish to pay it forward, to share with the world the lessons I have learned, my struggles and triumphs, and the story of my journey. This personal website is an offering, a gift of sorts, that I hope will inspire, inform, and entertain those who come across it.</p> <p>I must admit, I have developed a distaste for the proliferation of social media, especially as these platforms increasingly seek to monetize their users' attention. This website, in contrast, is my attempt to share my life and thoughts in a non-intrusive manner, with a focus on presenting meaningful and well-curated content.</p> <p>It has taken me some time to arrive at this point, and I have made several false starts in the past. But I am now resolute in my commitment to make this a worthy endeavor, and to share with the world the best of who I am and what I have to offer.</p>"},{"location":"books/startup/the_founders_dilemmas/","title":"The Founder's Dilemmas","text":""},{"location":"books/startup/the_founders_dilemmas/#what-motivated-me-to-read-this","title":"What motivated me to read this?","text":"<p>I came across this book while looking for good readings for startup founders, I am glad, I found this book.

It's better to be aware of it and keep it mind while taking decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy decisions at the foundational level are more likely to bad decisions, taking right decisions which are fair to all stakeholders involved, is quite challenging, its better to confront the challenge and take a decision which is required for long a term survival of startup.</p> </li> <li> <p>Startups require three types of resources: human capital, social capital &amp; financial capital.
